# OpenCart 3 Multistore

## Overview
Opencart 3 lacks full multistore support. This fork fixes this issue.
With multistore support this modified version can run multiple fully separate stores from same admin panel. This includes fully different catalogs that may or may not share the same products with same or different descriptions, prices, etc.
