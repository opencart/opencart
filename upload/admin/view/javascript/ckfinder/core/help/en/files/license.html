		3. License Models
	</h3>

		models, which restricts your rights of usage and integration of CKFinder under the
		terms of this license:

			will not be valid for sub-domains of the specified Web Site URL. </li>

	<p>
		License fees may be different depending on the license model.
	</p>
	<h3>
		4. License Validity
	</h3>
	<p>

		work that uses CKFinder, and doesn’t go in competition with CKFinder in the marketplace.
	</p>
	<h3>
		5. Unlicensed Copies
	</h3>
	<p>
		If you did not pay for a license, you may use unlicensed copies of CKFinder for
		the exclusive purpose of demonstration. In this case you will be using CKFinder
		in "demo mode". Without derogating from the forgoing, you may not use CKFinder in
		"demo mode" for commercial purposes. CKFinder shall be used only for evaluation
		purposes and may not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, including without
		limitation, external distribution or software development. You may not remove demo
		notices from the interface nor disable the ability to display such notices or otherwise
		modify CKFinder. Product support is not offered for CKFinder in "demo mode".

		on the purchase date and ends 365 days later. Such upgrades will include any upgrades
		for CKFinder that are released by CKSource for general distribution to CKFinder
		licensees during the one year period for which you are entitled to receive free
		upgrades. CKSource has no obligation to provide you with any upgrades that are
		not released for general distribution to CKSource's other licensees. Nothing in
		this Agreement shall be construed to obligate CKSource to provide upgrades to
		you under any circumstances.

		alongside with the executable version of it, or as integral part of it. Source Code
		files are clearly identified in the header of their contents. Other files are not
		part of the Source Code. You may modify and compile the Source Code. The Source
		Code or its modified version can be copied and distributed exclusively in respect
		to the scope of this license, as defined in the "License Model" terms of this license,
		as long as a valid license has been purchased for the distribution target. CKSource
		retains all rights over the Source Code and all parts of it present on modified
		versions of it. Redistributions of the Source Code and modified versions of it must
		contain the original headers and copyright notices. Modifications to the Source
		Code must be explicitly and entirely identified in the Source Code files. This section
		of the license supersedes all modification restrictions imposed by other sections
		of it.

		Without prejudice to any other rights, CKSource may terminate this License if
		you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this License. In such event,
